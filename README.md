# Gesture-Recognition-For-Smart-TV
Team Members - Amlan Panigrahi, Aman Verma

A project dedicated to train and deploy deep learning based gesture recognition models for Smart TV. The gestures to be predicted are as follows:
1. Swipe Left
2. Swipe Right
3. Swipe Up
4. Swipe Down
5. Stop

## Architectures Experimented
1. Conv2D + LSTM (Trasnfer Learning With ResNet-50)
2. Conv3D

## Progress So Far
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Training
3. Model Evaluation

## Planned Updates
1. To create better models that showcase good validation accuracy on unseen data. 
2. Test the gesture recognition model for inference in a system. 
3. Deploy model in a Smart TV
